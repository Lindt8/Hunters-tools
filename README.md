# Hunter's tools

This Python module contains a collection of my functions which I often utilize in other scripts and/or are just generally useful and could possibly be useful in the future.  It spans a wide range of applications and has been developed over many years of my usage of Python.  Broadly speaking, it is broken down into general purpose functions, science and engineering-related functions, and plotting-relevant functions.

One may use the functions by first placing the Hunters_tools.py Python script into a folder in their PYTHONPATH system variable or in the active directory and then just importing them normally ( from Hunters_tools import * ).

I have also written a similar tools module for usage with the DCHAIN-PHITS code; it can be found at [https://github.com/Lindt8/DCHAIN-Tools](https://github.com/Lindt8/DCHAIN-Tools).
