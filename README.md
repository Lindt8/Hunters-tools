This Python module contains a collection of my functions which I often utilize in other scripts and/or are just generally useful and could possibly be useful in the future.  It spans a wide range of applications and has been developed over many years of my usage of Python.  Broadly speaking, it is broken down into general purpose functions, science and engineering-related functions, and plotting-relevant functions.

One may use the functions by first placing the Hunters_tools.py Python script into a folder in their PYTHONPATH system variable or in the active directory and then just importing them normally ( from Hunters_tools import * ).

I have also written similar tools modules for usage with the PHITS and DCHAIN-PHITS codes; they can be found at [PHITS-Tools](https://github.com/Lindt8/PHITS-Tools) and [DCHAIN-Tools](https://github.com/Lindt8/DCHAIN-Tools).

All of the professionally-relevant Python modules I have developed are summarized [here](https://lindt8.github.io/professional-code-projects/), and more general information about me and the work I do / have done can be found on [my personal webpage](https://lindt8.github.io/).
